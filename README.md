[![Python Versions](https://img.shields.io/pypi/pyversions/ledshimdemo.svg)](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/ledshimdemo)

Display a variety of effects on the Raspberry Pi [led-shim](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/led-shim) from Pimoroni.

The effects are based on the examples given in the base [library](https://github.com/pimoroni/led-shim) plus some 
additions from my [fork](https://github.com/RatJuggler/led-shim/tree/more-examples).

- Binary Clock - Shows hours, minutes and seconds.
- Candle - A flickering candle.
- CheerLights - Synchronize with the [CheerLights](https://cheerlights.com) "Internet of Things" project.
- Coloured Lights - Simple coloured lights like Xmas lights.
- Gradient Graph - A moving colour gradient determined by the height of a sine wave.
- Rainbow - A slowly moving rainbow effect.
- Random Blink - Some random blinking.
- Solid Colours - A basic effect which just shows a sequence of solid colours.

**Note**: This project is completely over-engineered for what it actually does because it's being used as a learning exercise.

# Troubleshooting

If anything is going to cause a problem trying to run `ledshimdemo` it will be NumPy which is used by a couple of the 
demos. The NumPy package is included in most builds of Raspbian, but installed with `apt-get`, this then causes problems
if anything tries to install a different version with `pip3`. For this reason `ledshimdemo` is set to use the Raspbian
default version (see setup.py) to try and avoid installing a different version with `pip3`. However, if you do get a 
runtime error indicating a corrupted NumPy you could first try uninstalling any `pip3` versions of it to see if that
helps.
```
pip3 uninstall numpy
```
